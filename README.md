It's some kind of a Excel program with graphical interface.
this is a project for my university. In Description section you will learn more about my project according to our given project description.
# Description
There are many databases in different formats in the world that categorize information, Farabi Video Club has a database of its videos whose columns are specified and saved in .csv format, to improve the performance of the video club and easy When you are done, we first ask you to read the data source provided by the source file, convert its format and internal contents to a .json file and save it next to the project, then search by category and Add a new movie to the user via the command line or graphical environment, as well as the option to save the Jason file written in a specific path and with a specific name on the computer that the user provides these items. At the end, there is a button to end the program.

Footnote 1: Deleting videos based on ID can be considered as one of the points of the project, also creating an advanced search option that can apply several filters together will have a separate point.

Footnote 2: It is possible to use the json.simple library, if you use any other library, you should provide a brief explanation and the projects should be maven.

Footnote 3: The structure of our file is completely similar to the presented file and will be in .csv format, so do not worry about it :)

also I add some modification to the program even when there was no need to.
I add user interface and some other functions.
